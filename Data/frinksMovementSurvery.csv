Currently my 1rm Pull Up is Bw (58kg) @11-14%bf +18kg with good form, none of that shoulder rounding crap. I currently have a 10s Advanced tuck and a wanky 3s with my legs forward a bit more.

Combine all that with specific lever exercises (negatives, full rom raises and pullouts), bot at high intensity and low but high volume repetitions to make the Cns pathways more efficient and you have an effective formula.",67,20,168
